# Triangle Type Identifier

## Overview
The **Triangle Type Identifier** is a Python-based program that determines whether three given side lengths form a valid triangle. If they do, the program classifies the triangle as an **acute, right, or obtuse** triangle based on the side lengths.

## Features
- Takes user input for three side lengths.
- Checks if the given lengths form a valid triangle.
- Determines if the triangle is **acute, right, or obtuse**.
- Displays the result in the console.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/triangle-type-identifier.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd triangle-type-identifier
   ```
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python TryangleTypes.py
   ```

## Usage
1. The program prompts the user to enter three side lengths.
2. It checks if the three sides can form a triangle.
3. If they do, it classifies the triangle into one of the following:
   - **Acute Triangle**: All angles are less than 90 degrees.
   - **Right Triangle**: One angle is exactly 90 degrees.
   - **Obtuse Triangle**: One angle is greater than 90 degrees.
4. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, the program outputs an error message.

## Example Output
```
Enter the length of the first side: 5
Enter the length of the second side: 4
Enter the length of the third side: 3
Right triangle
```
